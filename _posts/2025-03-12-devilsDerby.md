Devil's Derby is a fast-paced first person shooter on skates, where you fight endless hordes of demons as you use advance movement techniques to shoot, skate, and slide your way around a singular arena to compete for high score.

My aim for this project was to create a game with a mangeable scope that I could release in a reasonable timeframe whilst working on it in my spare time. I also wanted to get experience in the release process of getting a game out on Steam, as well as marketing and trying to build an audience. Very happy how this has turned out- the game is very fun.
