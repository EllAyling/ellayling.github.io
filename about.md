Hello, my name is **Elliott Ayling**. I am an experienced Software Engineer focusing on development of C++ applications. My main focus has been on **graphical** and **system modelling** applications, and I have strong experience with **Vulkan**, and **OpenGL** (including **OpenGL ES**), using **GLSL** shaders.

I am knowledgeable within a range of environments, including **Windows** and **Linux**, with a focus on cross-platform compatibility using **CMake**, but also **HPC** (high performance computing) architectures involving parallel platforms.

Outside of my career I focus on game development. My most recent release was [Devil's Derby](https://store.steampowered.com/app/3121580) in 2025, using Unity game engine! And now I'm working on the next one.

I graduated from the University of Portsmouth in 2016 with a **1st class degree in Computer Games Technology**, earning two **awards**. During this time, I earned a large amount of experience over various technologies, but most noticeably with the **Unity 3D** game engine; and I also have experience with **Blender**.

Computer gaming has always been a big passion of mine since childhood!

Please take a look around my site, and get to know me, and the projects I have worked on!
